# Netflix Chatbot - INSY 660 Project

## Introduction
In the era of streaming wars, where content is abundant and choices are overwhelming, I recognized the need for a more intuitive and user-friendly way to navigate Netflix's vast library. Enter my creation: the Netflix Chatbot, a tool designed to revolutionize how viewers interact with their favourite streaming service. We aimed to develop a chatbot that enhances the user experience on Netflix by providing personalized recommendations, searching for shows, and addressing queries about Netflix content.

## The Challenge 
Netflix users often find themselves lost in a sea of content and issues that they have to navigate through manually. The challenge was to create a solution that simplifies this process, making content discovery more efficient, personalized, and enjoyable.

## The Solution
The Netflix Chatbot is a personalized assistant that interacts with users through natural language processing. It's not just a search tool; it's a smart companion that understands and anticipates viewer preferences and understands their issues, offering a tailored streaming experience.

## How It Works

### User Interaction
